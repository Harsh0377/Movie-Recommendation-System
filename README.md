# Movie-Recommendation-System
A content based movie recommender system.
I used datasets from kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
First we deal with the datasets and make model ("Movie Recommended.ipynb")<br/>
Create python file to run the project on localhost ("app.py")<br/>
Final project image ("image1.jpg","image2.jpg","image3.jpg")<br/>
